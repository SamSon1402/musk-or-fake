## OH MY GOD, THEY QUOTED ELON!

Welcome to "Musk or Fake" – the web game that does to Elon Musk quotes what South Park does to celebrities: relentlessly satirize them while making a weirdly valid point about society.

Many fake games out there, but this one? 100% real. Everyone's talking about it!

## WHAT THE #@$% IS THIS GAME?

A gloriously absurd challenge where you, a person with presumably too much free time, try to identify which Elon Musk quote is actually real among a sea of completely made-up bulls**t. Spoiler alert: it's harder than trying to explain NFTs to your grandparents.

We've carefully curated authentic Elon Musk wisdom and mixed it with absolute nonsense that sounds exactly like something he'd tweet at 3 AM after a Red Bull bender.

## RESPECT MY AUTHORITAH (FEATURES)

- **Daily New Quotes**: Fresh nonsense every day, just like your social media feed!
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Get berated by cartoon Elon when you're wrong!
- **Cutting Commentary**: Quotes that make you question if billionaires are just weird humans with too much money!
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Play it on the toilet, we won't judge!
- **No Ads**: This ad space was too powerful for AdSense.
- **Reset Button**: For when you want new quotes but don't want to use the refresh button like a normal person!

## HOW TO PLAY (FOR STUPID PEOPLE)

1. Read the quotes (Reading! Revolutionary concept!)
2. Click on the one you think Elon actually said
3. Watch cartoon Elon either praise your intelligence or mock your failure
4. Question everything you know about reality
5. Share your existential crisis with friends

## INSTALLATION (YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A BAD TIME IF YOU SKIP THIS)

```bash
# Clone this magnificent creation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/musk-or-fake.git

# Enter the truth zone
cd musk-or-fake

# Open in browser (or just double-click index.html like a caveman)
open index.html
```

## THE CREATORS (BLAME THEM)

Created by someone who clearly has too much free time and an unhealthy fascination with billionaire tweet habits. This is what happens when you mix programming skills with late-night Comedy Central binges.

## LEGAL DISCLAIMER (SUPER CEREAL STUFF)

We don't actually know Elon Musk. If we did, we'd probably ask him for a Tesla or something instead of making this game. All real quotes are from public sources, and fake quotes are generated with the same technology that's probably going to replace your job someday.

## SPECIAL THANKS

Special thanks to the creators of South Park for teaching us that the best way to discuss important topics is through crude humor and cartoon characters saying outrageous things.
